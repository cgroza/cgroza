## Hi! My name is Cristian. I am a computational geneticist studying structural variation.

- Currently, I am completing the [Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/2024-2025-eng.html) with Dr. Guillaume Lettre at the Montreal Heart Institute.
- Previously, I obtained my PhD from McGill University studying with Dr. Guillaume Bourque.

My work involves assembling human genomes and finding long stretches of DNA that are different between humans, called structural variants.
I then develop tools to genotype these in rare disease cases, map their epigenetic state and associate them with phenotypes.
I also hunt jumping genes for a living.

You can check all my research  on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=DzNAR8YAAAAJ&hl=en).
